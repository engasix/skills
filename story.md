# The Workflow

I previously worked in an organization, and I want to implement their workflow:

---

## Start Here

### 1. Lead Intake
They receive the lead.

### 2. Initial Sales Call
A sales agent goes on a call with the client and gathers an initial understanding of the project.

### 3. Handover to Business Analyst
The sales agent passes the information to the BA.  
*(This is where the skill **business-analyst** starts.)*

### 4. Requirement Analysis & Clarification
The BA analyzes everything and discusses the requirements with the architect (skill name **solution-architect**).

- If there are any hurdles or gray areas in the requirements, they clarify them with the client.
- If there is anything that is not possible or not allowed, they find an alternate solution that is applicable and acceptable to the client.

This process goes back and forth until all requirements are clear from the client to the technical team.

### 5. Proposal Document Creation
Once the requirements are clear, the BA generates a proposal document that includes:

- Project vision  
- Stakeholders  
- Features  
- Technology stack and preferences  
- Any third-party libraries or SDKs required for the solution  
- Timeline and cost  

### 6. Proposal Review & Sign-off
Once the document is ready and verified by the technical and BA teams, it is shared with the client.

- The client may ask for changes or clarifications.
- Once the document is signed, it moves into development.

### 7. Project Manager Assignment
A project manager is assigned to the project.  
*(This is where the skill **project-manager** starts.)*

### 8. Proposal as Source of Truth
The proposal document becomes the source of truth for the project manager.

The project manager discusses all requirements with the architect (skill name **solution-architect**), which helps them decide which platforms need to be developed, while the technology stack is already defined in the proposal document.

### 9. Task Creation & Dependency Management
Once the platforms are finalized, the project manager creates tasks for each platform in separate MD files.

- The project manager handles dependency management.
- For example, frontend tasks may depend on backend APIs, so there should be a clear reference to such dependencies.
- When a developer (skill name **software-engineer**) starts a task, they must confirm that dependent tasks are completed before beginning development.
- Tasks are organized into phases or modules.
- Once a task is completed by the developer, it is reviewed.

### 10. Quality Assurance & Issue Tracking
At the end of every module or phase, the project manager writes detailed instructions for QA (skill name **quality-assurance**) on how to test the module or phase.

- There are multiple test scenarios for each module.
- If QA finds any issues, they log them in an MD file (QA will generate the MD file if it does not already exist).
- File name format: `module-name.md`
- Issues are added using the same structure as tasks.
- Each issue includes complete details, steps to reproduce, navigation paths, and screenshots if needed.
- Each issue must reference the module being tested.

### 11. Issue Resolution
If any issues are reported by QA:

- The developer fixes them.
- Issues are marked as resolved in the MD file generated by QA.
- The developer may add comments explaining how the issue was fixed and the root cause.

### 12. QA Re-validation
QA checks the status of the issues they created in the MD file.

- If an issue is marked as resolved but is not actually fixed, QA can reopen it.
- If the issue is fixed, QA leaves a comment such as **FIXED**.

### 13. Deployment
Once all modules are developed and pass QA, the project manager asks the architect to deploy the project.

## Skills to Be Developed

We will develop the following skills together:

1. **business-analyst**
2. **solution-architect**
3. **project-manager**
4. **software-engineer**
5. **quality-assurance**

---

## Next Step

For now, we will develop **business-analyst** as a skill and later generate slash commands, sub-agents, and tools for this structure.
